Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n\nLet's calculate the standard deviation for each judge:\n\n1. **jaanu någisto**:\n   - Scores: [4, 8, 1, 9, 6, 3, 10, 5, 7]\n   - Mean: (4 + 8 + 1 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 10 + 5 + 7) / 9 = 6.33\n   - Variance: [(4-6.33)^2 + (8-6.33)^2 + (1-6.33)^2 + (9-6.33)^2 + (6-6.33)^2 + (3-6.33)^2 + (10-6.33)^2 + (5-6.33)^2 + (7-6.33)^2] / 9\n     = [5.7769 + 2.7769 + 27.5569 + 6.4881 + 0.1129 + 12.7569 + 15.3281 + 2.0736 + 0.0484] / 9\n     = 10.224 / 9 ≈ 1.136\n   - Standard Deviation: √1.136 ≈ 1.066\n\n2. **iiris vesik**:\n   - Scores: [4, 7, 5, 9, 6, 1, 10, 3, 2]\n   - Mean: (4 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 6 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 2) / 9 = 5.33\n   - Variance: [(4-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (5-5.33)^2 + (9-5.33)^2 + (6-5.33)^2 + (1-5.33)^2 + (10-5.33)^2 + (3-5.33)^2 + (2-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [1.7769 + 2.7769 + 0.1129 + 14.4881 + 0.0484 + 19.7569 + 20.4881 + 5.4289 + 9.4289] / 9\n     = 55.224 / 9 ≈ 6.136\n   - Standard Deviation: √6.136 ≈ 2.48\n\n3. **erik morna**:\n   - Scores: [3, 7, 10, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2]\n   - Mean: (3 + 7 + 10 + 6 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 2) / 9 = 5.33\n   - Variance: [(3-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (10-5.33)^2 + (6-5.33)^2 + (5-5.33)^2 + (9-5.33)^2 + (8-5.33)^2 + (1-5.33)^2 + (2-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [5.7769 + 2.7769 + 20.4881 + 0.0484 + 0.1129 + 12.7569 + 6.4881 + 19.7569 + 9.4289] / 9\n     = 75.224 / 9 ≈ 8.358\n   - Standard Deviation: √8.358 ≈ 2.89\n\n4. **veronika portsmuth**:\n   - Scores: [9, 1, 10, 7, 6, 8, 8, 4, 3]\n   - Mean: (9 + 1 + 10 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 3) / 9 = 6.33\n   - Variance: [(9-6.33)^2 + (1-6.33)^2 + (10-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (6-5.33)^2 + (8-5.33)^2 + (8-5.33)^2 + (4-5.33)^2 + (3-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [6.7769 + 27.5569 + 20.4881 + 2.7769 + 0.1129 + 6.4881 + 6.4881 + 2.0736 + 5.4289] / 9\n     = 55.224 / 9 ≈ 6.136\n   - Standard Deviation: √6.136 ≈ 2.48\n\n5. **chalice**:\n   - Scores: [6, 2, 9, 3, 8, 10, 7, 1, 4]\n   - Mean: (6 + 2 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 7 + 1 + 4) / 9 = 5.33\n   - Variance: [(6-5.33)^2 + (2-5.33)^2 + (9-5.33)^2 + (3-5.33)^2 + (8-5.33)^2 + (10-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (1-5.33)^2 + (4-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [0.1129 + 14.4881 + 14.4881 + 5.4289 + 6.4881 + 20.4881 + 2.7769 + 19.7569 + 2.0736] / 9\n     = 75.224 / 9 ≈ 8.358\n   - Standard Deviation: √8.358 ≈ 2.89\n\n6. **kristo rajasaare**:\n   - Scores: [2, 4, 10, 5, 3, 7, 6, 2, 1]\n   - Mean: (2 + 4 + 10 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 6 + 2 + 1) / 9 = 4.33\n   - Variance: [(2-4.33)^2 + (4-4.33)^2 + (10-5.33)^2 + (5-4.33)^2 + (3-4.33)^2 + (7-4.33)^2 + (6-4.33)^2 + (2-4.33)^2 + (1-4.33)^2] / 9\n     = [5.7769 + 0.1129 + 20.4881 + 0.0484 + 2.7769 + 6.4881 + 2.7769 + 5.4289 + 10.4289] / 9\n     = 55.224 / 9 ≈ 6.136\n   - Standard Deviation: √6.136 ≈ 2.48\n\n7. **hannaliisa uusmaa**:\n   - Scores: [3, 8, 9, 4, 7, 6, 5, 2, 1]\n   - Mean: (3 + 8 + 9 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 1) / 9 = 5.33\n   - Variance: [(3-5.33)^2 + (8-5.33)^2 + (9-5.33)^2 + (4-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (6-5.33)^2 + (5-5.33)^2 + (2-5.33)^2 + (1-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [5.7769 + 6.7769 + 14.4881 + 2.7769 + 2.7769 + 0.1129 + 0.1129 + 10.4289 + 10.4289] / 9\n     = 55.224 / 9 ≈ 6.136\n   - Standard Deviation: √6.136 ≈ 2.48\n\n8. **siim nestor**:\n   - Scores: [5, 9, 7, 8, 6, 4, 3, 1, 2]\n   - Mean: (5 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 2) / 9 = 5.33\n   - Variance: [(5-5.33)^2 + (9-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (8-5.33)^2 + (6-5.33)^2 + (4-5.33)^2 + (3-5.33)^2 + (1-5.33)^2 + (2-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [0.1129 + 14.4881 + 2.7769 + 6.4881 + 0.1129 + 2.7769 + 5.4289 + 19.7569 + 9.4289] / 9\n     = 75.224 / 9 ≈ 8.358\n   - Standard Deviation: √8.358 ≈ 2.89\n\n9. **peeter vã¤hi**:\n   - Scores: [6, 10, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]\n   - Mean: (6 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 9 = 5.33\n   - Variance: [(6-5.33)^2 + (10-5.33)^2 + (1-5.33)^2 + (2-5.33)^2 + (3-5.33)^2 + (7-5.33)^2 + (4-5.33)^2 + (5-5.33)^2 + (6-5.33)^2] / 9\n     = [0.1129 + 20.4881 + 19.7569 + 10.4289 + 5.4289 + 2.7769 + 2.7769 + 0.1129 + 0.1129] / 9\n     = 75.224 / 9 ≈ 8.358\n   - Standard Deviation: √8.358 ≈ 2.89\n\n10. **helen sildna**:\n    - Scores: [5, 8, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n    - Mean: (5 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 9 = 4.33\n    - Variance: [(5-4.33)^2 + (8-4.33)^2 + (6-4.33)^2 + (7-4.33)^2 + (4-4.33)^2 + (3-4.33)^2 + (2-4.33)^2 + (1-4.33)^2 + (2-4.33)^2] / 9\n      = [0.1129 + 14.4881 + 2.7769 + 6.4881 + 0.1129 + 2.7769 + 5.4289 + 10.4289 + 9.4289] / 9\n      = 75.224 / 9 ≈ 8.358\n    - Standard Deviation: √8.358 ≈ 2.89\n\n11. **ott lepland**:\n    - Scores: [6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n    - Mean: (6 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 9 = 3.33\n    - Variance: [(6-3.33)^2 + (7-3.33)^2 + (4-3.33)^2 + (3-3.33)^2 + (2-3.33)^2 + (1-3.33)^2 + (2-3.33)^2 + (1-3.33)^2 + (2-3.33)^"], "parsed_result": {"parsed_prediction": "", "Parse@1": false}}
