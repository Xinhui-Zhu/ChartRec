One common approach is to use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Load the data into a DataFrame.\n2. Calculate the IQR for each column (2011 and 2008).\n3. Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the IQR.\n4. Identify rows where the values in the columns are outside these bounds.\n5. Print the anomalies.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('table.csv')\n\n# Calculate the IQR for the '2011 (imf)' column\nQ1_2011 = df['2011 (imf)'].quantile(0.25)\nQ3_2011 = df['2011 (imf)'].quantile(0.75)\nIQR_2011 = Q3_2011 - Q1_2011\n\n# Calculate the IQR for the '2008 (cia factbook)' column\nQ1_2008 = df['2008 (cia factbook)'].quantile(0.25)\nQ3_2008 = df['2008 (cia factbook)'].quantile(0.75)\nIQR_2008 = Q3_2008 - Q1_2008\n\n# Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers\nlower_bound_2011 = Q1_2011 - 1.5 * IQR_2011\nupper_bound_2011 = Q3_2011 + 1.5 * IQR_2011\nlower_bound_2008 = Q1_2008 - 1.5 * IQR_2008\nupper_bound_2008 = Q3_2008 + 1.5 * IQR_2008\n\n# Identify anomalies\nanomalies = df[(df['2011 (imf)'] < lower_bound_2011) | (df['2011 (imf)'] > upper_bound_2011) |\n               (df['2008 (cia factbook)'] < lower_bound_2008) | (df['2008 (cia factbook)'] > upper_bound_2008)]\n\n# Prepare the final answer\nif anomalies.empty:\n    final_answer = \"No anomalies are detected in the table.\"\nelse:\n    anomaly_descriptions = []\n    for index, row in anomalies.iterrows():\n        if row['2011 (imf)'] < lower_bound_2011 or row['2011 (imf)'] > upper_bound_2011:\n            anomaly_descriptions.append(f\"row {index + 1} with {row['nation']} having an unusually {'high' if row['2011 (imf)'] > upper_bound_2011 else 'low'} value {row['2011 (imf)']} in the 2011 (imf) column\")\n        if row['2008 (cia factbook)'] < lower_bound_2008 or row['2008 (cia factbook)'] > upper_bound_2008:\n            anomaly_descriptions.append(f\"row {index + 1} with {row['nation']} having an unusually {'high' if row['2008 (cia factbook)'] > upper_bound_2008 else 'low'} value {row['2008 (cia factbook)']} in the 2008 (cia factbook) column\")\n    final_answer = f\"The anomalies are: {', '.join(anomaly_descriptions)}.\"\n\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n\nThis code will load the data, calculate the IQR for each column, determine the bounds for outliers, identify any anomalies, and print the final answer."], "parsed_result": {"parsed_prediction": "", "ecr_1": true, "Parse@1": false}}
