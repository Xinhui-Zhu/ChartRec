Look for any inconsistencies or unusual values in the \"Total\", \"Male\", and \"Female\" columns.\n   - Specifically, check for negative values, unusually high or low values, and any missing or unexpected data.\n3. **Identify Possible Explanations**: For each anomaly detected, provide a possible explanation based on the data.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndata = {\n    \"columns\": [\"Particulars\", \"Total\", \"Male\", \"Female\"],\n    \"data\": [\n        [\"Total No. of Houses\", \"14\", \"-\", \"-\"],\n        [\"Population\", \"55\", \"25\", \"30\"],\n        [\"Child (0-6)\", \"7\", \"3\", \"4\"],\n        [\"Schedule Caste\", \"1000\", \"500\", \"500\"],\n        [\"Schedule Tribe\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"],\n        [\"Literacy\", \"79.17 %\", \"86.36 %\", \"73.08 %\"],\n        [\"Total Workers\", \"15\", \"12\", \"3\"],\n        [\"Main Worker\", \"-10\", \"-5\", \"-5\"],\n        [\"Marginal Worker\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"]\n    ]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data[\"data\"], columns=data[\"columns\"])\n\n# Check for anomalies\nanomalies = []\n\n# Check for negative values\nnegative_values = df[df[df['Particulars'].isin(['Total Workers', 'Main Worker'])][['Total', 'Male', 'Female']].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').astype(int) < 0)\nfor col in ['Total', 'Male', 'Female']:\n    for index, row in negative_values.iterrows():\n        if row[col] < 0:\n            anomalies.append(f\"row {index + 1} with {row['Particulars']} having a negative value {row[col]} in the {col} column\")\n\n# Check for unusually high or low values\ntotal_population = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Population']['Total'].values[0])\nchild_population = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Child (0-6)']['Total'].values[0])\nschedule_caste_population = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Schedule Caste']['Total'].values[0])\nschedule_tribe_population = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Schedule Tribe']['Total'].values[0])\nliteracy_percentage = float(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Literacy']['Total'].values[0].strip('%'))\ntotal_workers = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Total Workers']['Total'].values[0])\nmain_worker = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Main Worker']['Total'].values[0])\nmarginal_worker = int(df[df['Particulars'] == 'Marginal Worker']['Total'].values[0])\n\n# Calculate expected values\nexpected_population = total_population -

We check for negative values in the \"Total\", \"Male\", and \"Female\" columns for the rows \"Total Workers\", \"Main Worker\", and \"Marginal Worker\".\n   - If any of these values are negative, we add it to the list of anomalies.\n\n2. **Unusually High or Low Values**:\n   - For the \"Population\" and \"Schedule Caste\" rows, we calculate the expected values and compare them to the given values.\n   - For \"Literacy\" and \"Total Workers\", we check if the given values are within a reasonable range (e.g., literacy rate should be between 0% and 100%, and the number of total workers should be positive).\n\n3. **Expected Values**:\n   - For \"Population\", we expect the sum of \"Child (0-6)\", \"Schedule Caste\", and \"Schedule Tribe\" to be less than the total population.\n   - For \"Literacy\", we assume a reasonable literacy rate (e.g., 80%).\n   - For \"Total Workers\", we sum \"Main Worker\" and \"Marginal Worker\" to get the expected total workers.\n\n4. **Comparison and Detection**:\n   - If any of the calculated values deviate significantly from the given values, we add it to the list of anomalies.\n\nFinal Answer: The anomalies detected are row 4 with Schedule Caste having an unusually high population 1000 compared to the total population 55, row 6 with Literacy having an unusually high literacy rate 79.17%, and row 7 with Total Workers having an unusually high number of workers 15."], "parsed_result": {"parsed_prediction": "", "ecr_1": false, "Parse@1": false}}
