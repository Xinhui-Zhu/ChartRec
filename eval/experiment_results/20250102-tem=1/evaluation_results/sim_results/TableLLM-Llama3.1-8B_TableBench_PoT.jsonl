Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Load the Data**: Load the table into a pandas DataFrame.\n2. **Data Cleaning**: Convert the relevant columns to numeric types for analysis.\n3. **Identify Anomalies**:\n   - Check for negative values in the Total Goals column, which is not possible as goals are typically positive.\n   - Compare the Sum of Total Goals across different seasons to ensure consistency.\n   - Identify any inconsistencies or outliers in the data.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndata = {\n
