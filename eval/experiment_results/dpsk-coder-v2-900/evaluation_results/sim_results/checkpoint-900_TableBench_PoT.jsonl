The results will be printed in the specified format.\n\nFinal Answer: The two anomalies are row 1 with Iași having an unusually high score 729243 in the 1977 column, and row 2 with Iași having an unusually high score 696884 in the 1966 column."], "parsed_result": {"parsed_prediction": "", "ecr_1": true, "Parse@1": false}}
